<h2>🙍🏻‍♂️ Hi! I'm Daryll.</h2>

I'm a computer science ~~student~~ _sensei_ who finds the math and language parts of CS fascinating. I specialize in data structures, algorithms, and programming language education. Basically, I teach people how to talk with computers and how to make computers do speedruns. <!--I currently serve as a member of our department's [Algorithms and Complexity Laboratory](https://aclab.dcs.upd.edu.ph/), where I investigate nonstandard models of computation. I also help out with various stuff as an ordinary CS student: from making problem sets for various courses to giving lectures and talks on different aspects of life in computer science. -->

Aside from toying with code, I really like watching anime and reading light novels (I've been told I consume obscene amounts of these; oh well). I also get addicted to puzzle games like the [Professor Layton series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Layton), reality shows like [The Genius (더 지니어스)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Genius_(TV_series)), and articles on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) from time to time.

I am an insane [Blue Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Archive) fan, in the most literal sense of the word. Kidding aside, it's one of the main reasons I became a _sensei_.

Oh, I also can't do sports for the life of me.

Life is about enjoying the journey, and I hope this place gives you a glimpse of how I do so! ^^
