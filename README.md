## ðŸ™‚ Hello!

I'm Daryll Ko, a computer science undergrad. I love **writing code** to streamline repetitive tasks and tackle abstract problems, **watching anime** and **reading light novels** to meet new characters and shape my life principles, and **learning how to learn** to continuously reach greater heights as a person.

As a cherry on top, I like **reflecting** on the things I do in order to course-correct if things don't go as planned, make realizations that I would've missed, or give myself a high-five if everything does work out.

Life is about enjoying the journey, and I hope this place gives you a glimpse of how I do so.

You can find me at the following places:
